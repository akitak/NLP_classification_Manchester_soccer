6.0,Why is everyone panicking about Haaland?,pghjuice412,1673979610,MCFC,"He‚Äôs only not scored in the last 3 games, one of them being the EFL cup games against Southampton where he only played 34 minutes.

Granted, his 6.67 against Everton has been his highest match rating in 4 games, but he buried one in that contest as well.

We all see him out on the pitch, looking for space and making incredible runs out there, still doing Haaland things.

He hasn‚Äôt scored in 2 league games and people act as if the sky is falling. He and the City midfield are too good to stay in ‚Äúpoor form‚Äù for much longer .

45.0,The club's situation is more seriously than you think. Txiki and Pep need to be responsible for this season failure,phannguyenduyhung,1673776982,MCFC,"Lets skip that rigged offside goal, but we are playing worse and worse this season. We can't even creates chances. Why ? I will explain my opinion under. But if we continue playing like this and buy no one in January, our season is finished. We will win NOTHING and probably out of Champions League in quarter final.  


* Firstly, lets looks at our wingers. There is no one. Yeah, not a fucking winger in our team. Foden is more an inside forward/attack midfielder and plays better in half-space. Grealish is absolutely not a winger, he is a creator, he has the ability to hold the ball to attract opponents then pass it to another. Mahrez is not a typical winger too despite he play out wide, he is more like a passer at wing and he can't even run anymore.

Thats why this season we pass the ball to Mahrez, Foden, Grealish and they pass it back all the time. The only option to attack is giving the ball to De Bruyne to make a far post cross.

=&gt; We need a winger to dribble past opponent, to run get in behind to receive through passes, to create **CHAOS**. 

Lets looks at player like Diaz from Liverpool, Saka and Martinelli from ARS, or even Mitoma from Brighton. Arsenal and Brighton have quite similar system with Man City, they wingers stay wide in build-up phase. Saka, Martinelli and Mitoma has speed and dribbling ability, they put a huge pressure to opponent fullbacks. They PUSH the opponent to the end of the goal line, they constant running off-ball to create space and distraction. And Ben White always overlap to create distraction and more option for Saka: cut inside - or pass to White - or pass back to √òdegaard. Their attacks are so fluid, so much variety, and the whole team play with higher tempo, higher pressure. Pep's system always requires good wingers too. The philosophy is overload one side and switch it to other side for winger to 1v1 with fullback. Pep used to has Henry, Pedro, Alves, Robben, Ribery, Douglas Costa (he was a beast in Pep's system), Coman,...

Sane and Sterling in 2018 - 2019 did this so good. Jesus too. And this year Txiki decide to sell BOTH Sterling and Jesus for our direct opponent and buying no one to replace ? LOL. (however Sterling deserves to be sold).

* Secondly, lets looks at our Leftback. We was trying to save some millions and decide to skip Cucurella. This is horrible. I thought Gomez was a good solution but he is not on the level to be in our XI at all. Not yet. He and Palmer playes like highschool student. And i need to mention Cancelo who was playing terrible this season. Since he receive that number 7 shirt and become another trash number 7 Portuguese in Manchester. Dont get me wrong, he played great last 2 season but he is not anymore. He is just a system player. Now he has been read like a book like opponent and his defence is not better than Arnold. And he wastes to many balls per match.

What we need is a quality Left-footed leftback who can overlap and fast. Kinda like Benjamin Mendy if he did'nt injured and go to jail. With a player profile like that Grealish will play much much better and play more inside. Cancelo is just nerfting Grealish. (both are right footed, like to cut inside, not a runner and hold the ball to long). I swear Pep did not expect to buy Grealish and then Mendy gone to jail. His plan was ruined.

* Thirdly, De Bruyne, Silva and Gundogan are becoming old. They dont have the energy to play with a high tempo pressure anymore. Their aibility in transition is becoming worse too. But this could be fixed in summer with a new signing (Enzo, Bellingham, De Jong ?)

&amp;#x200B;

* Finally, to summary we need to buy a winger and leftfooted leftback ASAP in January to save this season. This club problem is not Haaland fault. Txiki and Pep was too confident. We have second best net spend in EPL this season but Txiki doing nothing in transfer window. Lets look at ARS, Chelsea and Liverpool they are really actively buying to fix their problem. De Bruyne, Silva, Gundogan, Walker are not young anymore, i dont want to waste another year of their careers to end up in quarter or semi final of the champion league.

&amp;#x200B;

DO SOMETHING TXIKI !

And Kalvin Phillips has failed to launch with injuries and indifferent performances. 

Perhaps the team lacks at LB, CM and on the wing. But anyone supporting City over the past 5-8 years knows what this squad really needs is another diminutive, creative, ball-playing attacking midfielder. This is a Guardiola  team, and a Pellegrini team before him. Who needs Rafael Le√£o when we could shoehorn Xavi Simons into ‚Äúdefensive midfield‚Äù?

,Tickets through third parties,Jnelz22,1673358799,MCFC,"I'm taking my brother to England for his 30th birthday to go to a City game. The school he teaches at has their spring break when city hosts Arsenal, so that is the only game that works. However, as I'm sure you guys know, the game is sold out... even the hospitality experiences are sold out. I was willing to spend quite a bit to secure a seat, but I am wary of the third party sites such as LiveFootballTickets or Stubhub International since they do not seem like they are truly guaranteed.

Have you guys had any experiences with the third party sellers? Can I trust them? What about scalpers the day of the game?

I contacted City and they said some season ticket holders will put their tickets up for matchday cityzens - is this an avenue I could realistically go down or will that be a waste of time/money.

Would love to get to the Etihad one way or another"

Nowadays teams usually park the bus against us most of the time and it's difficult to maintain ball retention and passing in the final third, especially at the left side in which silva excels.

Bernardo and gundo are one of the best midfielders of this generation but there's something about Silva which is very different compared to them. 

With him in the midfield it was difficult for them to hold their final third. 

What do you think about this? This might be a nostalgia for me but the role of Silva was very efficient for midfielders like kdb to roam much free."

,I think its time for Bernardo to be sold.,Wheresthenearestrope,1673236100,MCFC,"I know this sounds a bit mental and I‚Äôm aware of his importance to the team with dynamism and flexibility he brings to the table but at some point the constant transfer rumours and wanting out is going to affect us. 
His constant talk about wanting to leave for several transfer windows has the chance to affect our morale as everyone knows he‚Äôs not committed to the club as much as everyone else, and also makes our stability suffer as he leaves as soon as we get a suitable offer.
Personally I think his transfer saga has already caused issues as I believe Grealish was brought in with the assumption of Bernardo leaving for Barca and now we‚Äôve got a logjam on the left wing.
Also if we sold now we still get high value instead of waiting for him to get older and his contract to run out. 
What are your guys opinions on this?"

I had to clip this and upload, cause I haven't yet seen a replay that includes Walker's skill and the ping over to Gomez. The goal is just so much better when you see Walker starting the move and then ending up with the assist. Man, we are some lucky bastards aren't we. CTID."

,Haaland is a TANK,2Maverick,1673216474,MCFC,"I'm watching his 20 PL goals highlight and he's just built different. People hate on him and say that it's easy for him because of all the amazing assists (which is partly true), but this guy finishes like a champ. Not many players can't replicate this. Not only is he built different, but this guy can sniff out goals and has the perception. Like KDB said in an interview, Haaland really shows that he's starving for goals. Goals are all that's on his mind. 

I feel bad for defenders facing him too because like I said, he's a TANK. When he gets in the box, it must be so hard for the defenders to use enough force to keep him out while not using too much to give MC a penalty, because if a guy like Haaland gets in there, you probably have to use more force than usual to contend him. You use a little bit too much, it's gonna look bad. Keeping up with Haaland's athleticism itself is already hard enough."

Sanchez - dodge (true colors showed when he went to the rags)

Koulibaly - dodge
Aubemayang - dodge (if any truth in the rumours he could have been great like he was for arsenal but primadonna)

I'm sure there are others I've missed but this all points to great club management... we waited an extra year for Rodri, a relative unknown, and wow!  Dias the same. Now Akanji, alvarez....

Pep finally started all of Foden, Walker, Cancelo and Bernardo (in an albeit confused formation) that left us chasing the ball for 45 mins.

What team do we want to see start on Sunday? 

I'd be keen for Alvarez to start, kdb to get rested and cancelo, bernardo and foden to get another outing. I'd also select Lewis ahead of walker.

So missing the sort of direct speed threat down our flanks.

Mohammed Kudus. Press resistant progressive carrier of the ball from midfield. Versatile in all attacking positions from winger to striker. Technically gifted and has a good sense of scoring goals in the right position. Sounds like a good replacement for either gundo or bernardo. 

Signing them both will still be cheaper than getting one jude bellingham."

,Anyone Think Our Attack Is Becoming Too Reliant on Haaland?,yeeeeeeeeeeteeeeeee,1672613210,MCFC,"Just a thought I've been having lately, but just wondering if I'm alone in thinking that our attack is becoming a bit too reliant on Haaland. I mean he's a monster, a goal machine, and when he's banging in as many goals as he is then well no complaints, and I'm not putting any blame on him. But, sometimes it feels as if our other attackers are now less focused on scoring themselves but rather just creating chances for him. It seems as if our attacking tactic is just get the ball to Haaland and pray. This works usually, but in games where he's marked tightly and controlled a bit more by the defense, I feel we've become a bit more toothless. When we can't get the ball to Haaland or when he's not on his best, it does worry me a bit. Maybe this is just reactionary, but just a thought and I want to hear y'alls opinions on it."

,January transfer window is now OPENüö® What moves should the club make?,Akash__A,1672577159,MCFC,"I know the club doesn‚Äôt like making moves in January but surely given our current form we have to do something. The club have mentioned the priority is a left back but surely given our recent games we try to buy a winger and when I say winger I mean a players whose actual position is a winger (fast, direct, can take on players and be clinical) and not a midfielder being forced to play out of position."
,What do you guys think of our recent inconsistent performances this season so far?,Gudguy_99,1672566165,MCFC,"What do you think is the problem with our recent performances this season?

We all know that we've not been that great/consistent since our win against United in the derby some months ago. These are the list of explanations which I think are the reasons for our inconsistent performances.

**A) change in the tactics** 

Inverted fullbacks are not good for us. Because of this Bernardo and Kdb are being deployed to the wings which is not working much for us this season.

Let's face it, mahrez and Grealish are inconsistent with their performances. They lack intensity, and acceleration and are not great in 1v1 with the defenders in the opposite box. They are predictable and it's frustrating to watch them like this in the match.

**B) Rotation and Game time** 

Rotating the players and giving the game time to others is good and it refreshes the squad but that's not the case with our current squad. 

Foden is a mile ahead of Grealish and mahrez this season. He has made more goal contributions than mahrez and Grealish combined this year but still, he gets benched to give game time to mahrez and Grealish because of past performances and pressure.

Foden and Alvarez deserve to be the front three of our current squad. They bring more intensity, press, and goal contribution compared to the other two.

I don't see much problem with our midfielders and I believe the change in the tactics is costing us this season.

If pep can give chances to Rico, Akanji, and Ake over Dias, walker, and cancelo then this should be the same applied to Grealish and mahrez.

**C) We need a good left back** 

Sam lee has also talked about this in a recent article that we might be looking for a new left-back. It looks like pep doesn't trust Gomez very much. I felt this was going to happen sooner or later. Cancelo is good as a left-back but he's not left-footed and this causes problems when it comes to crossing or overlapping with our wingers. 

Ake is also playing well as a defensive left back but with Rico playing in the midfield or walker being in the defense to stop counters this will cost us our attacking capabilities in the matches.

I know I might be wrong with some takes here, if so then what do you think are the reason for our inconsistencies?"

For those other clubs, the letters are made of rubber, and they‚Äôre a little sticky when you touch them, but for Man City, they just slide across.

I got a Man City jersey from the 21/22 season, and one of the sleeve immediately got a runaway thread. Even though I‚Äôve cut it several times, it always seems to find a way to pull away again, and the sleeve has lost some of the pattern on the end.

Finally, I just received a 22/23 replica home jersey for Christmas, and the letters of Etihad Airways are already peeling. For reference, I worse it for the first time a day ago, and I noticed that the letters were peeling. It hasn‚Äôt been washed or had any other traumatic experience.

Obviously, I have no problem with the designs of the jerseys; I love the way that this years home kit looks. I‚Äôve just noticed some design flaws of them which seem to make them inferior compared to a lot of other big clubs. What do you think about their quality?"

He is progressive in a way similar to Gundogan but he‚Äôs not the same profile that i find us most effective with. 

Enzo on the other hand i think i‚Äôd genuinely be happier to sign. I find him to have more of a passion for whoever he plays for and he, in my opinion is just as good as Bellingham and with Pep to nurture will be one of the best midfielders on the planet.

Both I think would require a totally new system for the midfield as neither are like for like for Gundogan so I think it begs the question which one would you rather have or is there anyone else to fit the role ready to get?"

,Selling A Piece of MCFC History,The_Pie-Eyed_Piper,1672286442,MCFC,"I have a two-of-a -kind 2019/20 MCFC Anthem Jacket that was made specially for winners of the 2019 Trophy Tour Contest that was open to Supporters Club members in the countries where the tour made stops. This was the tour that featured all 4 Domestic Trophies (PL, EPL, FA, Community Shield). There was only one winner chosen from each of the stops. Because of various issues, not every winner was able to attend, but the winners from USA, Brazil, China, Korea, UAE, India, and Thailand were in attendance with a guest. In addition to the many activities, including staying at the MCFC Training Facility Dormitories (they were nice) and going on the pitch to stand for pics with the trophies at halftime of the City/Leicester match at the Ethiad, they all received a custom jackets with their national flag on the sleeve. 

I have one of the two American jackets. Size 2XL. It was worn during some of the special access events and hasn‚Äôt been worn since, so it is in excellent condition. I intend on selling it, I‚Äôm just not yet sure how to go about doing it. I‚Äôd like to get $200 for it, but I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôm just going to see what happens. I‚Äôm likely going to list it somewhere with buyer and seller protection, but I figured I would let real fans know in case they want to look at the listing. 

Full Disclosure: I am not a City fan, but I was the guest of one and that was enough for everyone I came in contact with to be welcoming, and really gracious. I did my best to reciprocate, going so far as to dress appropriately when necessary. This was free airfare and transportation, acommodations, and a Premier league, match and tons of activities and access that isn‚Äôt of available otherwise, so it was a small price to pay. I left with a lot of respect for the club, and more importantly the individuals at all levels who come together to make it what it is. Everyone was amazing. I posted a couple of videos of what little I recorded on here before. 

The selfie is me standing on the balcony of the room at the training facility. You can see one of many training grounds in the reflection of the sliding glass door. Anyway, if you‚Äôre interested in the jacket, message me."

But today, my team was back and I am glad to be able to be downvoted once again for saying: 

Grealish sucked. 

Should have had two goals, barely had an assist, made meandering, pointless runs w the ball from the sideline back through his D. Even his own teammates were clearly exasperated w him in the final third. 

(I was actually happy to see him play for a while though. That's a first. Also enjoyed watching him wind up Leeds players as the game went on.)"

Quick search for resale tickets brought me to SeatPick, but I'm not familiar as I live in the US. Has anyone gotten tickets through SeatPick before or is there a better alternative?

I'd rather not commit to offsite hospitality just for the general admission ticket so we could go to Mary D's or somewhere similar before the match."

,Looking to buy tickets as a foreigner,Edin_103,1671938539,MCFC,"Hey guys, 

Sorry if this has been answered or is better answered elsewhere, but what's the best way to get matchday tickets?

I'm looking to fly in from NZ next April for either the Arsenal game on the 26th (I believe) or the Chelsea game in late May. 

I've been on the city site and everything is pretty much sold out (2 seats next to each other, that is) this far in advance. 

Other sites are reselling for ridiculous prices, so wondering whether there's a go-to site for us foreigners that aren't season pass holders or what have you. 

Cheers"

,Fantasy League Update - Game Week 16,Silentbobni,1671634849,MCFC,"Was holding off posting this until after the world cup was finished just to give people a gentle reminder that the league returns on the 26th.

Congrats to leader 93:20 on 1004 for breaking the 4 figure score barrier, second is the previously mentioned great named Haaland down under on 985 and rounding out the top 3 and continuing the Haaland puns is Haalan D'or on 980.

MVP this week goes to totally unpunneried name Team Name with an impressive 86. 

Unlimited free transfers for this game week so go mad, no cut off for a deadline on the website but I'd assume it's 11:00 UK time as standard for a 12:30 kick off. 

Cup competition doesn't start until gameweek 29 so plenty of time for anyone interested. 

Big thanks to all 492 of you that have signed up, details below for anyone still wanting to join.

,Quick write up on City vs Girona for those unable to watch,Aephino,1671289290,MCFC,"Unsure if there is a Post Match Thread and I can take this down if that appears.

‚ÄîStarters‚Äî

Ortega: Decent, but when you have by far the #1 GK with his feet and distribution in the world it can make everyone else look poor in comparison. 

Lewis: Alright, but I expected more from him in this match. I do forget he‚Äôs only 17. 

Charles: My MOTM outside of the senior players. Outstanding performance and never switched off defensively. 

Katongo: Just slightly behind Charles. Also performed at a very high level and looked solid. 

Gomez: Good match but defensively still has lapses. 

Gundogan: Extremely quality midfielder and was a level above almost every player on the field. 

Palmer: Absolutely is first team quality. Sublime performance in midfield.

De Bruyne: Best midfielder in the world. 

Mahrez: Glimpses of peak Riyad but overall didn‚Äôt have his best match. Still a quality technical player on the ball and will hopefully play a major part in City‚Äôs trophy challenges this season. 

Haaland: Best striker in the world. His relentlessness is unbelievable to watch.

Roger: Not a bad match. Didn‚Äôt have the chemistry with the other forwards and midfield. 

‚ÄîSubs‚Äî

Borges: Disappointing. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get another chance but he did not take this one. Far too many giveaways but redeemed himself only slightly by tracking back defensively. 

Bobb: Decent performance but false 9 is a tricky role for City at the moment since we‚Äôre most used to Haaland, who is a true 9 that gets in behind. 

Robertson: Perfect cameo. I hadn‚Äôt heard much of him before but didn‚Äôt put a foot wrong in midfield. Extremely tidy. 

McDonald: Another solid little cameo. Didn‚Äôt try to force anything and played simple, smart football."

,Buying tickets for football games is so confusing...,frequent__nomad,1671185999,MCFC,"I know nothing about football, but my 13 year old has declared himself a Man City fan and I want to get two tickets to a home game in February or March (Newcastle or West Ham by the look if it).

I try to buy tickets on the official website, they aren't there. There's hospitality tickets, but the cheapest ones are 'offsite', does that mean I wouldn't be in the stadium for the game? Or is it just the build up to the game?  


There's all these unofficial sites then that are offering tickets, but how do they have them? Should I trust them?  


I just want 2 tickets, roughly halfway close to the pitch. Am I just being thick?"

I remember reading that Alf Inge said that an offer from Real Madrid was ""Too good to be turned down."" Or something like that. Although Endrick was also a City target, him signing for Real Madrid could mean Haaland stays for a tad bit longer. Thoughts?"

,Man City helped me deal with my anxiety a little,tastelesscookielady,1670517873,MCFC,"A few years back, I lost my mum and got anxiety because I didn't grieve well. It was so bad that I couldn't sit through games because my mind was always going ""but what if we lose?"". It might not sound like a big deal but it's the same with a lot of other things. My therapist says I tend to think of worst case scenario because I had something as final as death affect me so I can't help but feel the same for things around me... Anyway, I had to learn to watch games again because I missed it. I started with the small games. I'd tune in once City were up and watch just enough to reassure myself that we were winning. The bigger games were harder to tackle but I got there eventually. I think the thing that helped me deal with my anxiety the most is that most wins by Man City are predictable. And I've come to accept the ones that aren't too. I'll sit and watch a game vs spurs knowing that somehow we'll control the game and they'll have 1 shot on target and 1 goal by the end of the match.

It's honestly been really helpful. I love that we win even though rivals always say we're boring. And I'm so glad I can sit through whole games again. I was actually proud of myself for sitting through that final game against Villa last season, when before I'd have turned off the TV the moment they went a goal up. Ended up being one of the best moments in my life as a football fan. I even watch the ones where we're losing. I tell myself if I can tackle the anxiety that comes with supporting a sports team, then I can tackle anything. So thanks Man City."

However, seeing him in a Barca shirt is nothing but a vague dream for me. However, do you guys believe there is a slightest possibility for it to happen? What if you were offered Frankie De Jong and some for a swap - would you be happy with it and could Rodri ever want to play for Barca?

,Carlos Borges and/or Joel Ndala Need to be Given a Chance,Bathcat5,1670212108,MCFC,"They're both excellent prospects and we are desperate for a pacey, powerful winger who can take a man on and chip in with goals and assists. Essentially a true replacement for Sane. Borges in particular I believe has a huge future ahead of him assuming he doesn't have attitude problems. He's lightning quick, a great finisher and even better dribbler. He's just got the x factor. He reminds me of a left wing version of Ousmane Dembele, which I think could be incredibly deadly under Pep's guidance. And if he doesn't work out, just try Ndala. Though admittedly he may still be a bit young. We're most likely not going to buy a left winger in January. Why not give Borges a shot? Shit, why not Mbude?"

A being City/PSG for example, B tier being Chelsea and other teams that have the potential int he very near future, and then C level teams. 

United needs a wake up call but the fans especially on reddit as so happy to accept their current situation and blame Ronaldo for everything. They forget what he did for them last year. He seems to be the only one that has the attitude and desire to be an A level team. 

Shit is just funny lol. What a delusional fanbase. They haven't been close to what they were under SAF and there's nothing concrete to show the world they can get back to that level. They haven't even come close to beating us in the league since SAF. They are fighting for an Europa league spot LOL. Oh man, this is just fun to observe.

,The Brentford loss was waiting to happen,death-of-the-sun,1668873471,MCFC,"I know I'm pretty late to the party but here I am. Before I begin, I'd like to state that I would love to be proven wrong and I hope I'm just overreacting, but I couldn't help but notice the steady decline in our playing form, leading to us losing to Brentford.

I would pinpoint the beginning of the decline to after the Southampton game, since after that game, we just weren't playing the same way.

The Copenhagen 0-0 was an unfortunate game and can, probably, just be brought down to a disallowed goal, a missed penalty, a red card and the absence of Haaland. And the fact that both Dortmund and Sevilla drew their games in Copenhagen.

The subsequent Liverpool loss was to be expected seeing that they were at an unbeaten streak at Anfield. However, the Liverpool we played wasn't the same Liverpool from last season. Their unbeaten run was just waiting to be ended and it's shocking how we weren't the ones to put an end to it.

The Brighon game, on surface, might seem like the team regained its form, however the 3-1 result doesn't paint the full picture. We scored from a goalkeeper assist, a penalty and an outside-the-box KDB brilliance. Neither of which are team goals like we're used to seeing. Us nearly conceding another goal was an indicator that we have a shaky defence.

The Dortmund 0-0 was a lullaby of a game. While it is true that it didn't matter, as a draw was sufficient to top the group, it was still a very disappointing result. Our attack was toothless despite Haaland playing in the first half. Mahrez missing his penatly probably did contribute quite a bit to the game being as slow-paced as it was, but it is below the City standard to win with just a one penalty lead against Dortmund.

The Leicester game was worrying. To rely on a KDB inch-perfect freekick to win against a formerly 20th place team is just weird. It was beginning to look like without Haaland we just couldn't build attacks.

The Sevilla game I'm not going to complain about. We were treating it like a training game and still managed to put 3 past them. Yes, we had beaten them 0-4 away but even if we lost, we would have topped the group anyway.

Fulham should've been an easy win, only we decided to make it spicy. An early red accompanied by a penalty was unfortunate, but we did what we could; and in the end we had to rely on a KDB dive in the box in the last minute of the game to grab those 3 points.

The Chelsea game was bizzare. Them having a higher xG is worrysome. Thank lord for Ortega deciding to become prime Neuer that day. Again, we had to rely on a Mahrez brilliance, and thankfully, a rare, these days it seems, team goal. Our attack was fine that game; the problem only lay in our defence. 

And finally, Brentford was just waiting to happen. I think it is a good thing that Pep is finally able to see that there has been something going on with the team; may it be the players already mentally being at the WC or something more insidious; whatever it is, I hope Pep spends sleepless nights looking for where the flaws are and thinking of ways to fix them.

To summarise, after my not-so-thorough analysis, I've come to conclude that after that Saints game, our form has been in-and-out. Of course, I've been spoiled by just how good this team can be, and obviously, every good team has a stroke of bad luck just like this. I am aware that we've been playing without a second fullback and a few games without our main striker. But to counter that, I just have to say that we are bloody citeh, mate! Anyway, I'd to hear what you guys think!"

,Something is off with the formation,Mission_Care_1078,1668324032,MCFC,"I dont know how in. every bad game , the position was so ovious . like halaand being sandwich between 2 -3 defenders and not getting the same type of side  crosses attack from either Kevin , or cancelo  ,a   foden surprise goal , which resulted from a  cross from non other than Kevin . can we just admit that pep in this case lost it tactically , No. I dont blame pep , if anything I agree with Messi pep knows and reads. formation like hand book , but I realised because city had ben wining and haaland has been scoring we never rally noticed  that win is not  = team performance . haaland  last minute wonder strike against bvb kinda reduces the fact that borussa dormund  managed to lock mancity a very longer time just like Liverpool did, but against Southampton mancity game flowed but we can see that haaland  only managed to find the net at the very end through a pass  after being sandwich against 2 defenders  in the whole game . So I still think that man city  has not been used with a tradition 9 like haaland and his presence might have come with its drawback that simply catching up now. rather than later . honestly  I would say this world  cup timing might have Been a blessing in disguise for the team and peep to really think it through all the weak points with  Man City formation . 

There was a comment in Instagram that said Man City game flowed more fluidly. with a false 9 like Alvarez but with haaland the same cannot be said despite  the goals he scores since the team attacking pattern seems so one dimensional . and I honestly  dont know how to react to this comment that got  almost 5K likes  and was the top comment . 

\+ I cannot beleive Brentford defenders managed haaland when , he demolished Bayern munich backline with ease and scored against NUER  , back when. both lewadowski and muller were there  to score and Hernandez  and kimmich were marking his position  . so it definitely seems that haaland technique needs revamp rather than him relying on brute force which seems to not working against team where 2 -3 defenders and even goal keepers are marking him . Haaland needs better technique or more freedom outside the  penalty box in his movement to score  because the game against Brentford showed penalty area can be congested . honestly seeing so many people on twitter and instagram, and even neutral saying haaland is a fraud and quite average footballer if you cut his service is quite painful even though , they seems  to forget hanland was much more involved in buildup with borussa dortmund . and  was nothing like the tap in people saying  its the position and style pep is using for haaland and the entire team where creativity and attacking pattern seems rigitand very one dimensional  even Phil  and Bernardo is not being used more creatively Like they  were even until last year  is it because of Jesus and sterling or something more ."
,Subs x,Mancinisknittedscarf,1668318336,MCFC,"Just quite infuriating. I understand in Pep (We Trust) not making subs when the rhythm is good/we‚Äôre playing well(ish)

But today was abject. Bernardo wasted on the wing, Phil‚Äôs touch all over the place. KDB misplacing passes and even Ederson actually saved some shots.

The team was out of sorts but he made no changes until far too late.

If anything, he‚Äôll think that the subs ruined the rhythm and that‚Äôs why we conceded late.

There‚Äôs far too much talent on the bench not to give them 20/30 minutes when we‚Äôre chasing a game.

It‚Äôs like he cannot stomach the idea of having selected an imperfect starting 11."

,The team needs to get their heads sorted soon or risk being left behind.,Jyuan83,1668306651,MCFC,"We deserve fully the defeat by brentford of all people. It is one thing to lose despite putting in our best efforts but another thing altogether in completely not putting in any kind of focus in the running or passing. Gundo suddenly forgot how to pass and finish, kdb suddenly has an aversion to running hard, cancelo is still very much mentally affected by his mistake made against salah, no one is really feeding haaland to the point where he suddenly became the one feeding everyone else with his cutbacks with no one in the box finishing off the chances. Everyone‚Äôs head is in Qatar, thinking about the world cup, saving themselves for this tournament squeezed in the middle of an already packed schedule. No one wants to run hard or put in the yards for each other. This is against brentford, no offence but just a few years ago, they were in the championship. We are city, we have had 7 years of stability under the same manager in pep. If we cannot finish off teams like brentford at home to get maximum points then we are definitely in trouble. Everyone is tired, i get that. Kdb barely had rest from last season and now he‚Äôs looking at potentially 60 plus games this season if we really go far in all competitions plus the world cup. This fatigue will only get worse after the world cup as we have 16 players coming back from Qatar, the most out of all clubs in the league. I am really worried about our season collapsing. We have been poor in a number of games this season, often relying on the individual brilliance of our players saving us instead of depending on our collective tactical know-how in past seasons to dominate play. Brentford dominated us in the first 15 minutes of play in our backyard. Toney almost did a rodrygo against us on the last few minutes of play. We must not let the real madrid lesson be in vain. Mental strength is lacking at this point. I do not care if this gets downvoted, this needs to be said."
,Do you think Man City would be able to win the title this season?,hmansloth,1668303974,MCFC,The reason why I‚Äôm asking is because we‚Äôre 5 points behind Arsenal and Man City‚Äôs form has not been looking good as of late (since the loss to Liverpool they‚Äôve been very out of touch and inconsistent). But with the World Cup coming and the potential injuries and fatigue our players would get do you think that Man City would be able to get back on track and possibly edge Arsenal out? Or would we crash and burn even further?
,Are the players quality really improving with Guardiola training regime,Mission_Care_1078,1668299104,MCFC,"I honestly dont know how to better phrase myself , but here I go . I respect pep a lot but imo , I dont think his training is helping haaland become better at his weaknesses ,  haaland uses up a lot of his physical strength when scoring under pep , and he scores  a lot . But after todays performance, and the performance against. Southampton ,  and the first leg and second  cl group stage against bvb  performance , showed a reoccurring theme about haaland movement and positioning  that is the opponent  team defenders always two or  three  of them sandwiching haaland  in between , and haaland not using technique to cruise through but sheer physical  brute force which will become useless infront of technical defenders . I feel like pep regime and style has worsened haaland quality and technique . yes he scores a lot of  and probably injure him more . he score  goals but the quality so far has been questionable  since we all saw him scoring last minute against Southampton and bvb but nobody ever seems to ponder that both of those games , haaland was practically locked and quiet and today game against Brentford simply watched up him since Toney causing through Man City. backline , but haled couldn't do the same he genuinely looked frustrated and little lost since his physical brute force  and positioning weren't working unlike other times , Halaaland was twenty when he absolutely cruised through Bayern munich defense system and scored against  THE  Neuer  a time when muller and Lewandowski both were playing against him. and scored twice , the performance was  so glorious . , back then he was still scoring mostly from penalty box and had occasion  outside the box goals , but his movement never felt rigit  or almost mechanical with no hint of creativity or flair nor defenders were sandwiching him through his positing  , is it because Brentford , Southampton and bvb has better defense NO ,  haaland positioning was never set just on taking crossing passes in penalty box he actually had more freedom in central  and more creative attacking  style  by  himself  and even won occasional 1v1 duel through technique of his ball control not sheer brute force .  something I haven't seen haaland doing in premiere league even once . . 

Haaland didnt press Brentford, nor Liverpool or Southampton or bvb  through technique . he used his brute strength  , but all 4 of them had more technically gifted defenders . to block his force . 

He mostly was so used  to to use his brute  body strength  that it is almost clear , the difference between Phil foot technique to   won 1v1 against other defenders  and even toney cruising through Man City backline , vs haaland whose brute force  to tackle defenders  against Brentford and Liverpool were not working since defenders like them need ball press and more dribbling or atleast genuine pressing whether through foot or shoulder and need more agility , haaland  foot technique lacks the flair to get out of even normal PL defenders like Gomez  . The front line in penalty area was  so congested today and even other games  that I wonder  , is pep  purposely not teaching  haaland  any technique on how to  press and atleast give him training in ball control  or a little dribble , since he has been falling down a lot and even  in particular situation lose control of the ball against Southampton and Liverpool ,  and Brentford . or pep hasn't got a clue how to better improve haaland  overall game and only brought him to take cross and services from the players around him in penalty area as a designated place and hoped no rival manager would be able to crack his obvious tactic .

Honestly at times like this  I feel like haaland is just an shor-term  outlier whose finishing  is being used for certain purpose without much  input  or effort from the club  for more  versatile development  from his  existing  ablities and technique he has    ,  because  I still haven't seen haaaland learning to press defenders like Alvarez  or foden . hopefully im just reaching  , and haaland has been trained to become more versatile in his attack but it doesnt seems like right  now .  

Same with cancelo  and Mahrez , their attack is surprising weak and predictable , It cannot be a coincidence so many players attack and movements feels this predictable and almost rigid . and was more ovious agains  Brentford"

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ytjdnr)"
,Twitter is a mess .,Mission_Care_1078,1668284321,MCFC,"So basically Darwin Nunez and Jesus are far better player and haaland is a tap in merchant who is a clinical finisher but cant play football beside Kevin de bryne or Man City team service .

And now nunez brain dead fans  in twitter trending that  that Nunez is just 12 goals behind haaland for golden boot and neutral English fans are posting that  haaland is just a pr marketing tactic / football product for ballon d'or and not a genuine talented player just because he missed 1 important premiere league game and a unimportant cl game against Sevilla and only came around into last minute against Fulham , and couldn't get into rating in the last 3 weeks . and only had two genuine bad performance 1 against Liverpool and another today in premiere league . üòµ‚Äçüí´ .  

The thing is haaland doesn't have the traditional support of a country population as fans who ae dominant in football like Argentina , Spain , Brazil and even urugunay . You could say he doenst even have a legend from his country that could provide him support or atleast hype in football unlike alvaraz who has Messi flair , Nunez has Suarez , and all the other Brazilian player who are in national team whose history and legends are as long as football itself . And on top of that haaland doesnt play in a premiere league club that is loved by all English population  and  pundit like Liverpool , man united and recently arsenal . he plays for city who are still has pretty nice fandom and hated by premiere league fans and pundits but even in Man City fandom I genuinely think the fondness towards him. is very superficial based on his goals and recent achievements and sucess/hype.

Honestly I wont even be surprised if the injury had affected haaland more mentally than physically  and it came from a. ex team mate who probably knew where to tackle  him more damage , and it is quite evident how easily he was getting tiered and was breathing heavily since his last game against Fulham and today, some of his movements were weird too. I think people are taking haaland is a machine too literally that football fans are so out of touch regarding pressure and mental health about human Brain and body .

whichever neutral football space I see, I almost feel like either other fans are indirectly wishing him injury or pundits are doom glooming over his sustainable form . and when it will fall . or simply. over the top bystander trying to prove why haaland is a tap in merchant who doesn't belong in a generational talent list simply because he only score tap in and doenst contribute in the buildup / dribble like all the legends of ballon door winner , and on top of that him being injury prone is a running gag that has been more heightened .which is not true , his injuries are quite normal and even if he is injury prone lets just say it is nothing a careful observation that big clubs can't afford for their players health and fitness and can be managed meticulously . I feel like not many neutral football fan in premier league genuinely wish his success , and I dont know why is it the team he plays, Is it jealousy , or something else or is it because his success has risen in a. short span of time . Right now especially the after the ballon d'or ceremony where Drogba made that haaland comment on Lewandowski , I feel that was already a jinx ,and right now haaland simply has too much pressure , the way every journalist Viying , pep in conference regarding haaland and his participation and all the inquisitive question I about him is simply too much . I genuinely hope pep makes a curt answer after that he wont answer nny question about haaland from now and dont give journalist anything to talk about and that riola haaland agent really need a warning from the club and haaland and his father himself to not open her mouth .

haaland one answer in a. recent interview regarding defenders being scared of him is being torn to shred after todays game as if , haaland is the next Zlatan type , the guy was literally given the script to answer that way , I honestly dont think premiere league and their journalisers are ready to have a mega star who shines too bright even if they don't want to have the spotlight themselves and was set by the British media themselves but also getting torn to shreds . I know player are taught to handle pressure but honestly , I genuinely hope haaland can shut up the faceless trolls after WC breaks and come back stronger mentally , he looked exhausted and genuinely not as in form in todays game , and I genuinely dont want to believe his goals so far in premiere league were a purple patch because I have followed him since slazburg , and I know haaland play style hasn't been the same since his operation , but I still think he has it in him to score a lot until he is 30-31 , maybe after that he will slow down , but I still think. if haaland is carefully managed medically and injury wise by stuff he will score a lot and still has chance to further develop his technique where he lacks , I means he is only 22.  so why cant football neutrals just let him grow and give him more time and patience , I think haaland deserve that much from premiere league fans"
,"Twitter is a mess , and I genuinely feel sorry for Haaland the most",Mission_Care_1078,1668282687,MCFC,"So basically Darwin Nunez and Jesus are far better player and haaland is a tap in merchant  who  is a clinical finisher but cant play football beside Kevin de bryne or Man City team service . 

And now nunez brain dead fans are d\*ck riding in  twitter that Nunez is just 12 goals behind haaland for golden boot and haaland is just a pr marketing tactic / football product for ballon d'or and not a genuine  talented player just because he missed 1 important  premiere league game and a unimportant cl game  against Sevilla and only came around into last minute against Fulham , and couldn't get into rating in  the last 3 weeks . and only had two genuine bad performance 1 against Liverpool and another today in premiere league  .  üòµ‚Äçüí´

The thing is haaland doesn't have the traditional support of a country population as fans who ae  dominant in football  like Argentina , Spain , Brazil and even urugunay  . You could say he doenst even have a legend from his country that could provide him support  or atleast hype in  football unlike alvaraz  who has  Messi flair  ,  Nunez has Suarez , and  all the other Brazilian  player who are in national team whose  history  and legends are as    long as football itself  .  And on top of that haaland  doesnt play in a premiere league club that is loved by all  English population and d\*ck ride by English pundit like  Liverpool , man united and recently  arsenal . he pays for city who are still has pretty nice fandom   and hated by premiere league fans and pundits but even in  Man City fandom I  genuinely  think the fondness towards him. is very superficial based on his goals and recent achievements  and sucess/hype.   

So I really wonder why wouldn't haaalnd be mentally affected , the guy just came from a injury after last season disastrous injuries , on top of that, the injury came from a.  previous team mate who probably knew where to strike him the most damage , his  left  foot ankle  . on top of that he has ton of pressure  because of  on his market value / sponsorship deals ,  where really needs to marketing wise hype himself enough for a ballon d'or + his agent is riola . 

Honestly I wont even be surprised if  the injury had affected haaland more mentally than physically , and it is quite evident how easily he was getting tiered and was breathing heavily since his last game against Fulham  and today,  some  of his movements  weird too.  I think people are taking haaland is a machine too literally taht football fans are so out of touch regarding pressure and mental health . 

whichever neutral  football space I see,  I almost feel like either other fans are indirectly wishing him injury or pundits are doom glooming over his sustainable form  . and when it will fall . or simply. over the top bystander trying to prove why haaland is a tap in merchant who doesn't belong in a generational talent  list simply because he only score tap in and doenst contribute in the buildup / dribble like all  the legends of ballon door winner , and on top of that him being injury prone is a running gag that has been more heightened  .which is not true , his injuries are quite normal and even if he is injury prone lets just say it is nothing a  careful observation that big clubs can't  afford for their players health and fitness  and can be  managed meticulously  .  I feel like not many neutral football fan in premier league   genuinely wish his success  , and I dont know why is it the team he plays,  Is it jealousy , or something else or is it because his success has risen in a. short span of time .  Right now especially the after the ballon d'or ceremony where Drogba made that haaland comment on Lewandowski , I feel that was already a jinx ,and right now  haaland simply has too much pressure , the way every journalist Viying , pep in conference regarding haaland and his participation and all the inquisitive question I about him is simply too much .  I genuinely hope pep makes a curt answer after that he wont answer nny question about haaland from now and dont give journalist anything to talk bout and that riola haaland agent really need a waring from the club and haaland and his father himself  to not open her mouth . 

haaland one answer in a.  recent interview  regarding defenders being scared of him is being torn to shred after todays  game as if ,  haaland  is the next Zlatan  type , the guy was literally given the script to answer that way , I honestly dont think premiere league and their journalisers  are  ready to have a mega star who shines too bright  even if they don't want to have the spotlight themselves and was  set  by the British  media  themselves but also getting torn to shreds  .

,Staring to see the effects of Ortega?,MCBM10,1668270306,MCFC,It‚Äôs only been one game but after the great performance from ortega it did seem like ederson was a lot better this game. Hopefully this wasn‚Äôt a coincidence and is actually the result of competition bringing ederson back to his best. A lot of people recently are overlooking how good ederson is at shot stopped because of a slight dip in form and think our system is the only reason he plays for us. He‚Äôs always been very capable in all parts of keeping and hopefully he‚Äôll be back to his best.

I was hoping for suggestions on other teams nearby that I could go see. Championship, League One etc..

Any suggestions appreciated. Outside of football suggestions also welcome."

MVP this week goes to Ake Computer (superb punnery, took me a while to spot it) with 83 which is more impressive considering having Cancelo and his red card minus points. 

No Friday night fixtures this week so cut off for transfers is 11:00 UK time on Saturday. 

Cup competition doesn't start until gameweek 29 so plenty of time for anyone interested.

I think from blues that i‚Äôve spoke to today about the draw we all seem a bit overly confident. Leipzig seem like a quality side and they have players like that we can possibly struggle with. 

Last season it wasn‚Äôt easy against them obviously we lost with a weak side in Germany and won at home 6-3 but this is an in form side. Christopher Nkunku has been arguably one of the best players in the world recently and our defender struggled against him last year so i just don‚Äôt know.

But am I the only one who could see  that the form and  style Napoli plays right now  that too with a weak team compare to them like Frankfurt automatically  is a big  hurdle for mancity before finals or even semi finals . I honestly fear a semi finals round against Napoli with the formation and style  they play , against city right now more than Real Madrid or even Bayern or psg  . Because khvicha and victor osimhen + Leo skiri  and Juan Jesus wont be a easy opponent against haaland , kdb,   and Phil . +. Napoli simply has atleast one  outstanding player in every position like midfielder ,  left and right winger  and a  defender . City right now lacking pacy winger especially in the right side  and a overall  lack of solid versatility in  attacking    formation not just haaland in the box , is something I fear Napoli will exploit the most with their midfielders   and wingers having similar style with oshimen getting cross pases from khvicha like kdb does for haaland . I genuinely hope pep gets a pacy winger  in winter , who can solidify the attacking formation  more from  both side  + I hope walker and Philips really can step up  in the foreseeable future if Napoli face mancity ."

,I'm starting to get frustrated with our performances this season.,jayjay-bay,1667673380,MCFC,"City vs Fulham is on as I'm typing this. There are 4 minutes left of injury time at the Etihad, Cancelo has been sent off, and I know that we're a man down but for 45 minutes we've practically done nothing but hoof long balls to nowhere. Hey, we got a pen in the 95th minute. Lucky us I guess. Except, it's not, because what I was watching almost felt like deja vu. 

Cancelo having a stinker and then getting sent off has been coming for weeks. Over his past 3 or so years here, he seems to have an annual event in his calendar around december, written in red ink. It must say: ""time to stink it up"", because his yearly dip in form isn't even a surprise to me anymore. It's hugely frustrating because we know how good this guy actually is, yet he just can't find the consistency to perform at his peak for a whole season of football.
Additionally, with Cancelo now suspended and Walker injured, we have ZERO senior full-backs in our squad. You can talk about the young prospects, and while they are very exciting and have huge potential, they're not good enough to fill the gap yet. For our next two games of football, Pep will most likely start two centre-backs out of position as full-backs. For me, that's completely unacceptable, especially when we could've brought in at least one ready-made stand-in during the transfer window. 

Back to our performances. We've just managed to beat Fulham at the Etihad by the skin of our teeth. Yes we were playing 10v11 for almost the entire match - but there's still so much left to be desired by the way we handled things. The thing is though, that's not even close to being the first time this season this has happened. On Wednesday we were poor in the first half vs Sevilla. We were extremely poor and created next to nothing vs Leicester. Same story away at Dortmund. Brighton was decent but it never felt like we were completely in control, especially when they missed a sitter to equalize for 2-2. Liverpool speaks for itself, we were nowhere near our best. Kobenhavn away was the most typical City I think I've seen. Now, the 4 games before that one; Southampton, Kobenhavn, United and Wolves, were absolutely fantastic and for a while it looked like nothing could stop us. But that run was off the back of Dortmund at home where we were poor imo. Then we have Villa away which was awful, and Newcastle away in a 3-3 draw. Mind you it's not even Christmas yet. 

These are way too many poor performances for the standards we've set. Our defence doesn't even look close to settled, we're conceding almost a goal per game. And our midfield has been wildly inconsistent - especially Rodri. We've played 19 matches in all comps so far, and 8 of them have been absolute stinkers. I wasn't really bothered when we were poor in near dead rubber games vs Kobenhavn and Dortmund, but this is happening way too often to be ignored. We can absolutely forget about going to a CL semi or final this season if all this continues. Even the league might slip away from us if we don't find the defensive stability and the composure to string together a run. It's just not been good enough. I've been almost ignoring these bad performances for a while now, trusting that it'll be better next time, that it's just one of those days. But it's not, it can't be one of those rare days when you're having them every other game. It's frustrating to see how fragile we are, and how inconsistent we've really been since the start of the season. Something needs to change, because we have looked absolutely brilliant in some phases. It is crucial for our season that we see more of that going forward."

MVP this week goes to probably the best new team name I've seen in ages, Haaland Oates with a damn impressive 103 points. 

No Friday night fixtures this week so cut off for transfers is 11:00 UK time on Saturday. 

Cup competition doesn't start until gameweek 29 so plenty of time for anyone interested.
